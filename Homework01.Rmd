```

```{r, results='hide'}

library(magrittr)
```

## Challenge 1

```{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2021-datasets/main/darwin.txt"
darwin <- read_delim(f, "\n", col_names = T)
```

Number of paragraphs in the chapter
```{r}
nrow(darwin)
```

34th paragraph
```{r}
darwin[[34,1]]
```

Split this vector into a new vector, split, comprising a vector of 1-word character strings
```{r}
split <- c()
for (i in darwin) {
  tmp <- stringr::str_split(i, " ")
  for (j in tmp) {
    split <- c(split, gsub("[[:punct:]]","", j))
  }
}
```

How many unique words are there in this vector?
```{r}
length(unique(split))
```

What is the most common word? 
```{r}
split %>% as.factor() %>% summary() -> extract(1)
```

How many words appear 1 time? How many words appear 5 or more times?
```{r}

```
